This is a dummy food_delivery_app where user can login and authenticate their accounts with google! The main reason for doing this was to learn about the use of Nest.js for backend and Next.js for frontend. 
Additionally, it uses Prisma which is an ORM that uses TypedSQL which is a new way to write SQL queries that are type-safe and even easier to add to your workflow. 
Many more functionalities can be added to this project. I will do it when I get time :). Moreover, this is not mby my own!! I have made this from watching YouTube video.
